<b>You know, this world isn’t run by laws written on paper. It’s run by people. Some by law, some by no law. It’s up to each person to make their world, and how they make it. And you need a lot of luck to keep someone else from making your life hell. And it’s not as simple as they taught us in grade school, but it’s good to have strong convictions and stick to them. In marriage, in crime, in war, in everything and every time.</b>
